      <h2>Level 1: Publish globally unique identifiers</h2>
      <p>The <a href="#dfn-semantic-web">Semantic Web</a> is built around the basic principle that we need to use the same names when we publish information about the same things. This does not only account for real-world objects like a person or a building, but also for attribute/relationship names and more abstract concepts like a person's gender or interest. Doing this allows a machine to interpret how multiple sources of information relate to each other.</p>
      <p>The <a href="#dfn-uri">URI</a> standard offers a uniform syntax for globally unique identifiers, which can be used to .....</p>

        <h3>Publish URIs for your own data</h3>
        <p>TODO</p>
        <aside class="example">
          <p>Our DBeerPedia website offers a catalogue for craft beers, where information about each individual beer can be viewed in a web browser as an HTML web page. The URL for the web page offering information about the beer <i>La Trappe Quadrupel</i> would be:</p>
          <pre>
            https://dbeerpedia.org/beers/6283746/la-trappe-quadrupel
          </pre>
          <p>Because we want developers to build cool end-user apps by leveraging our data, we also provide a REST API. The URL for the same piece of information in a more structured form is:</p>
          <pre>
            https://api.dbeerpedia.org/v1/beers/6283746
          </pre>
          <p>The corresponding JSON response payload would be:</p>
          <pre>
            {
              "id": 6283746,
              "name": "La Trappe Quadrupel",
              "description": "In 1991, The Koningshoeven brewery baptized her beloved Quadrupel under the approving glance of the monks. A closely guarded recipe became reality, and the first Quadrupel beer in the world was born."
            }
          </pre>
        </aside>
        <p>In this example, it's interesting to note that there are multiple documents describing the same beer, namely the HTML web page and the API response. There could even be more than one API, such as a GraphQL service. In the API response, the value of the `id` attribute is probably the primary key of the record in which this review is stored in the website's database.</p>
        <p>Another interesting thing to note is that the HTML URL does not only contain this local identifier, but also some human-readable value (often called a "slug") to make the URL more attractive for humans and to improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</p>
        <p>If the website owner wants other organizations to be able to link to this beer (e.g. a beer review website), it should provide globally unique identifiers. Documents created by other organizations and published on external domains will then be able to provide link references to these resources.</p>
        <aside class="example">
          <p>Globally unique URIs look like this:</p>
          <pre>
            http://dbeerpedia.org/id/beer/6283746
          </pre>
          <p>To expose these URIs to the website's audience, these URIs need to be added to the API response:</p>
          <pre>
            {
              "@id": "http://dbeerpedia.org/id/beer/6283746",
              "name": "La Trappe Quadrupel",
              "description": "In 1991, The Koningshoeven brewery baptized her beloved Quadrupel under the approving glance of the monks. A closely guarded recipe became reality, and the first Quadrupel beer in the world was born."
            }
          </pre>
          <p>Please note the corresponding web page and REST endpoints remains unchanged:</p>
          <pre>
            https://dbeerpedia.org/beers/6283746/la-trappe-quadrupel
            https://api.dbeerpedia.org/v1/beers/6283746
          </pre>
        </aside>
        <p>This example contains two modifications compared to the previous example:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The attribute name has changed from `id` to `@id`</li>
          <li>The local identifier is replaced with the globally unique URI</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">If there is a certain need for publishing local identifiers, there is nothing against publishing both. In that case, there could be an `id` attribute as well as an `@id` attribute.</p>
